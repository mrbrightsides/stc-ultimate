- **Hardware wallets** (Ledger, Trezor) for large amounts

---

### Is my personal data stored on the blockchain?

**No.** Only non-identifiable data goes on-chain.

**On-Chain (Public, Immutable):**
- Wallet addresses (0x742c44a...) - pseudonymous
- Transaction amounts, timestamps
- Smart contract interactions
- No names, emails, passport info

**Off-Chain (Private, Deletable):**
- Name, email, phone (optional, for notifications)
- Travel preferences
- Review text
- Profile photos

**Location Data:**
- GPS coordinates only shared when you explicitly check in
- Not stored permanently
- Only used for milestone verification
- Not sold to third parties

**Compliance:**
- GDPR (EU): Right to deletion, data portability
- CCPA (California): Right to opt-out, data disclosure
- Indonesia PDPA: Local data residency

---

### Can the platform be hacked?

**Risk Mitigation:**

1. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Audited by third-party firms (planned)
   - Open-source for community review
   - Bug bounty program (coming soon)
   - Multi-signature wallets for treasury

2. **Frontend Security**
   - All API calls authenticated
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Input validation (no SQL injection)
   - HTTPS only (no HTTP)

3. **No Central Point of Failure**
   - Blockchain is decentralized (no "delete button")
   - IPFS for asset storage (distributed)
   - Multiple RPC providers (redundancy)

4. **User Funds**
   - Non-custodial (you control your crypto)
   - No "platform wallet" holding user funds
   - Escrow contracts time-limited (auto-release if stuck)

**Potential Risks:**
- Smart contract bugs (mitigated by audits)
- Phishing attacks (user education)
- Front-end vulnerabilities (regular security testing)

**Security Response:**
- 24-hour security monitoring
- Incident response team
- Insurance fund for smart contract exploits (planned)

## Pulau Penyengat Pilot Project

### What is the Pulau Penyengat pilot project?

**Overview:**

**Pulau Penyengat** is a small heritage island in **Bintan, Riau Islands, Indonesia**.

**Historical Significance:**
- Former capital of Johor-Riau Sultanate
- Islamic heritage sites:
  - Masjid Raya Sultan Riau (grand mosque)
  - Makam Raja-Raja (royal cemetery)
  - Istana Penyengat (sultan's palace ruins)
- Rich Malay culture and history

**Current Challenge:**
- Underutilized tourism potential
- Limited digital presence
- Small local businesses need support
- Heritage preservation funding needed

**STC Ultimate Pilot:**
- Deploy full platform for Pulau Penyengat
- Blockchain-based ticket sales
- Virtual 3D tours of heritage sites
- Local SME onboarding (10-15 businesses)
- IoT sensors for visitor tracking
- Community DAO for heritage preservation

**Target Launch:** Q2-Q3 2024

**Expected Impact:**
- Increase tourism by 30-50%
- Generate revenue for heritage restoration
- Empower local SMEs (higher income, lower fees)
- Create Indonesia's first blockchain heritage island
- Blueprint for other islands/destinations

### How will payments work on Pulau Penyengat?

**Multi-Currency Support:**

1. **Cryptocurrency**
   - ETH on Base (low fees)
   - IDRT (Indonesian Rupiah Token, 1:1 IDR)

2. **Traditional Payment** (Fallback)
   - Credit card (via payment gateway)
   - Bank transfer (instant settlement via IDRT)

**Payment Flow Example:**

**International Tourist (Singapore):**
1. Buy ETH or IDRT on exchange
2. Book heritage tour on STC app
3. Pay 100,000 IDR (≈ $6.50) in IDRT
4. Smart contract splits payment:
   - 40% → Local tour guide (instant)
   - 30% → Heritage preservation fund (DAO-managed)
   - 20% → Boat operator (instant)
   - 10% → Island maintenance fund

**Local Tourist (Indonesia):**
1. Buy IDRT on Tokocrypto/Indodax
2. Or use credit card → auto-convert to IDRT
3. Same payment flow as above

**Zero friction, instant settlement, transparent distribution.**

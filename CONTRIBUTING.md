## 🛠️ **Development Workflow**

### Step 1: Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stc-ultimate.git
cd stc-ultimate

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/stc-ultimate.git
```

### Step 2: Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix-name
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` — New features (e.g., `feature/multi-currency-support`)
- `fix/` — Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/escrow-release-error`)
- `docs/` — Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/setup-guide`)
- `refactor/` — Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/revenue-split-logic`)
- `test/` — Test additions/improvements (e.g., `test/escrow-manager`)

### Step 3: Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Configure your .env.local (see SETUP.md)
```

### Step 4: Make Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow [Coding Standards](#coding-standards)
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation if needed

### Step 5: Test Locally

```bash
# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Type checking
pnpm type-check

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Build production version
pnpm build
```

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive on mobile/desktop
- [ ] Wallet connection still works
- [ ] Smart contract interactions succeed
- [ ] No broken links or missing assets

### Step 6: Commit Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message (see guidelines below)
git commit -m "feat: add multi-currency swap support"
```

### Step 7: Push & Create Pull Request

## 🎨 **Coding Standards**

### TypeScript Guidelines

✅ **Do:**
- Use explicit types for all variables, parameters, and return values
- Define interfaces at the top of files
- Use `type` imports: `import type { Foo } from 'bar'`
- Handle errors with try/catch blocks
- Use functional components with TypeScript types

❌ **Don't:**
- Use `any` type (unless absolutely necessary with documentation)
- Use implicit types
- Access object properties without proper typing
- Skip error handling in async functions

**Example:**

```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface BookingParams {
  serviceName: string;
  amount: bigint;
  operatorAddress: Address;
}

export function createBooking(params: BookingParams): Promise<string> {
  // implementation
}

// ❌ Bad
export function createBooking(params: any) {
  // missing types
}
```

### React Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Add `'use client'` directive for client components
- Use `useEffect` cleanup functions
- Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`
- Handle loading and error states

❌ **Don't:**
- Use class components
- Forget to cleanup subscriptions/timers
- Mutate state directly
- Create infinite render loops

**Example:**

```tsx
// ✅ Good
'use client';

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import type { Address } from 'viem';

interface WalletBadgeProps {
  address: Address;
}

export function WalletBadge({ address }: WalletBadgeProps): JSX.Element {
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState<bigint | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let cancelled = false;

    async function fetchBalance() {
      const result = await getBalance(address);
      if (!cancelled) setBalance(result);
    }

    fetchBalance();

    return () => {
      cancelled = true;
    };
  }, [address]);

  return <div>{balance?.toString()}</div>;
}
```

### Styling Guidelines

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes for styling
- Keep components responsive with Tailwind breakpoints: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`
- Use the neon-themed color palette for consistency:
  - Purple: `bg-purple-500`, `text-purple-400`
  - Pink: `bg-pink-500`, `text-pink-400`
  - Cyan: `bg-cyan-500`, `text-cyan-400`
- Add sufficient top padding on mobile: `pt-12 sm:pt-16`
- Ensure text contrast for accessibility (black text on white backgrounds by default)

### File Organization

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `kebab-case.tsx` (e.g., `activity-timeline.tsx`)
- **Components**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ActivityTimeline`)
- **Functions**: `camelCase` (e.g., `createBooking`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_ESCROW_AMOUNT`)
- **Interfaces**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `BookingParams`)
- **Hooks**: `useCamelCase` (e.g., `useEscrowManager`)

## Introduction

The **HCPS-Tourism 5.0 Framework** represents a paradigm shift in how we approach smart tourism systems. By integrating Human Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS) with Tourism 5.0 principles, we create a holistic ecosystem that addresses the needs of all stakeholders while maintaining sustainability, resilience, and human-centricity.

### Key Innovation
This framework uniquely combines blockchain technology, IoT infrastructure, AI-driven personalization, and metaverse experiences into a unified platform that empowers both tourists and small-medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia.

âœ… Show txHash in SCADA with "View on Etherscan" button  
âœ… Export report includes blockchain verification  
âœ… Analytics dashboard shows system performance trends  
âœ… Timeline demonstrates blockchain â†’ IoT causality  

### For Academic Paper

âœ… Reference Sepolia Etherscan for verification  
âœ… Export charts and metrics for publication figures  
âœ… Methodology: "Event-driven IoT integration via smart contracts"  
âœ… Statistical analysis from Event History Analytics  

### Verification Steps
1. Make test payment on Sepolia testnet
2. Check transaction receipt captured
3. Verify events parsed correctly
4. Confirm IoT actions generated
5. Validate SCADA displays real data
6. Export report and verify txHash links

## Known Limitations

### Current Scope
- **Testnet Only**: Currently deployed on Sepolia testnet (not mainnet)
- **Mock IoT Hardware**: Physical IoT devices not connected (simulated)
- **Storage**: Uses localStorage (max 100 events, browser-dependent)
- **Webhook Delivery**: Best-effort delivery, no guaranteed persistence

### Future Considerations
- Mainnet deployment requires gas optimization
- Physical IoT hardware integration via MQTT/HTTP
- Database storage for production-scale event history
- Webhook queue system for guaranteed delivery
- Advanced analytics (ML-based anomaly detection)

---

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- No breaking changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- New features are additive only
- Data migration not required (fresh event tracking)

### For Developers
- Import new contexts where needed: `import { useBlockchainEvents } from '@/contexts/blockchain-events-context'`
- Access event data: `const { events, iotActions, stats } = useBlockchainEvents()`
- Export utilities available: `import { exportToPDF, exportToCSV } from '@/lib/export-utils'`
